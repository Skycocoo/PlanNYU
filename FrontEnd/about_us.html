		<h1> What is PlanNYU? </h1>
			
		<p> PlanNYU is an application containing the information of all classes taught at NYU from Brooklyn, to Washington Square, to Shanghai. The purpose of PlanNYU is to help you generate your class schedule before undertaking the burden of navigating through Albert's interface </p>
			
		<hr /> 
		<h1> What seperates PlanNYU from Albert? <h1>
		<p> Our site features a simple and elegant interface that allows you to place your desired class into a planner within seconds. Once in the planner, you will be able to view all class sections without leaving the planner page. Once you select a class section, all other conflicting sections belonging to any other class will be cancelled out, thus eliminating time conflicts before they even occur. A calander is also present on screen during the whole process allowing you to visually see the progress of your schedule. </p>
		<hr />
		<h1> Who are we? </h1>
		<p> PlanNYU was created by two NYU students during the Summer of 2016. Instead of enjoying the summer breeze they locked themselves in and thought about making the world a better place one step at a time! We are not affiliated with NYU and will never ask for your credentials. </p>
