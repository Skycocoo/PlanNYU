### Original README

www.plannyu.com (not affiliated with NYU)    
An application that provides students with a convenient way to create their class schedules. 
We are slowly moving towards open source! Since this is supposed to help the community, they should have the right to contribute.  
<i>I will try and add more comments to make everything more readable</i>

We treat this application as a learning experience. Therefore, you do not need experience to contribute! When you have made your modifications, submit a <i>pull request</i> so we can add it into the official repository.

The Front End is recommended for people who are interested in:
<ul>
<li>Web development</li>
<li>Graphics</li>
<li>UX/UI</li>
</ul>

The Back End is recommended for people who are interested in:
<ul>
<li>Database management and/or NoSQL</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>NodeJS</li>
<li>Computer Networking</li>
<li>Servers</li>
</ul>  

(Or you can do both!)

How to get started:  
1. Install NodeJS and MongoDB (look around the internet for more details).
2. Create a database with MongoDB and name it PlanNYU. 
3. Create a collection for each json file in the <i>Dump</i> folder and import the data into their respective collections.
4. In your browser, go to <i>localhost:3000</i>. The application is live at localhost and at port 3000 of your machine.

You may have to play around with ports and file directories to get everything to work.
